# FlareZone

A simple sci-fi zone generator for the Elysium Flare RPG by Brad Murray (https://www.patreon.com/halfjack).  You can see this running at http://binary-systems.net.

<!-- ## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

<!-- ### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
``` -->

### Installing

Pull down the source, create a virtual environment, active the virtualenv, and install the requirements.

```
git clone https://github.com/mhglover/flarezone.git
cd flarezone
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

#### Flask
You can develop locally by running in Flask in debug mode. Debug mode will automatically reload the application upon changes to the source.
```
export FLASK_APP=flarezone.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
python -m flask run
```

Browse to http://localhost:5000

#### Passenger

We're using Passenger at Dreamhost for running at binary-systems.net. If you've got Passenger installed, you can run it with:
```
passenger start
```

<!-- ## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us. -->

<!-- ## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags).  -->

## Data Files

Each zone type (Hub, Rim, Gulf, and each Arm) should have a YAML file in the _data_ directory to define the characteristics to be generated for a given world in that area. 

For the Proximity characteristic, I'm using an array with an integer for each category.

## Zone and Planet Names
We're using code derived from Sayam Qazi's [planet-name-generator](https://github.com/sayamqazi/planet-name-generator) for building zone and planet names. You can modify the planet name corpus by editing _planet.txt_ and removing or adding planet names separated into syllables with dashes: _Jupiter_ becomes *ju-pi-ter*
. Planetary suffixes are defined in the _generate.py_ script itself in the _genName()_ method.

## Fonts

We're using Google Fonts because we can both include the TrueType files in the application for generating labels on the images as well as refer to Google's hosted version of the font for rendering the HTML text in your browser. 

The following fonts are included:

* [Crushed] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crushed?selection.family=Crushed)
